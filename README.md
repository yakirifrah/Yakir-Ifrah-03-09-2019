# Weather App

> Weather Forecasting App gives you an easy way to Know the weather of some city

All data from [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/),
I used 3 endpoints: ​[location autocomplete](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-locations-api/apis/get/locations/v1/cities/autocomplete)​ for the search field, ​[get current weather​](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-current-conditions-api/apis/get/currentconditions/v1/%7BlocationKey%7D) and [5-day daily forecast​](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-forecast-api/apis/get/forecasts/v1/daily/5day/%7BlocationKey%7D).
